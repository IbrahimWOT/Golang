# 🚀 My Go Learning Journey
Welcome to my learning repository where I share my progress in mastering the **Go (Golang) programming language**.
I'm documenting everything—from concurrency primitives to package management—to track my development and help others follow along.

 📅 Progress

🎯 Goals
My roadmap for success in Go:
* Master Go's core concurrency model (goroutines and channels).
* Build practical command-line interface (CLI) tools.
* Understand and utilize Go's standard library extensively.
* Document and share my code daily via this repository.
